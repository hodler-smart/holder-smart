Hello,

We are aware of Circulate Money, Zino Finance, ZeroG, PerfectSwap, and Hypervault.

We also have one of your former developer addresses: 0xF4c8916A6E722B52415C1866edC3cb09E15671EF.

In addition, we have records of the websites you used (such as Tenderly with the project ButcherFinance, and even https://luma.com/user/usr-TiWmGDBYqiDIQHt).

You now have 24 hours to keep 10% and return the rest. After that, you know very well it will be quite simple for the authorities to track you down.

The deal is simple.
We await your response.

Regards
